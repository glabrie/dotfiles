# Personal Dotfiles

## Welcome and disclaimer

Hello and welcome to my personal playground. I'm a complete noob learning NixOS and a bunch of things along the way! I'm currently learning and the process is messy, so please don't clone it expecting an amazing base config to start. you're more than welcome to suggest improvements though ^_^

## Flakes and home-manager
The current setup uses Flakes and home-manager. It's much cleaner than it used to, but still needs heavy work. I'll be separating the configs in modules and reviewing the general schema soon. I also need to import the configs into home-manager for the most part, so there's a decent amount missing from the repo right now, like the hyprland config for example. Soonâ„¢!
